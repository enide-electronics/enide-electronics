- 👋 Hello, @enide-electronics is the account for some of the source code I publish on the [Enide!](http://www.enide.net) website
- 👀 Here you will find the source code for some projects that use PIC or AVR microcontrollers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to survive with the Arduino "IDE" and the always outdated dependencies of PlatformIO
- 💞️ All source code published here should be under a open-source license, so feel free to use it and report back any problems you find
- 📫 How to reach me ? Either use Github or email.
